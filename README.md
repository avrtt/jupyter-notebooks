## My collection of Jupyter notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering various data science and machine learning problems.  
The [Kaggle folder](https://github.com/Lenferdetroud/jupyter-notebooks/tree/master/!%20KAGGLE) is for storing scripts and kernels used in competitions.  
The [YouTube folder](https://github.com/Lenferdetroud/jupyter-notebooks/tree/master/!%20YOUTUBE) contains the notebooks used on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpPtaqqxzFqm9rZAh2xC5OA).
